## How To Play

You are the conductor on the train and look after the wellbeing of the passengers. In each carriage there is a food dispenser from which you take food for the passengers. Over time, the health of the passengers decreases and you have to use the health dispenser at the back of the train to heal the passengers. Over time, the dispensers also break and need to be repaired through a simple mini-game in which you have to write a falling object. The game ends when you reach the station or a passenger dies.
